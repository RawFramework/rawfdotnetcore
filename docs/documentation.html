              otherwise you will only see the framework in action but you will not be
              able to modify the generated code or the templates to suit your needs,

                    It's required that you already have a database schema
                    defined on your SQLEXPRESS instance, by convention the name of your new application should match the
                    name of the database, RAW framework by default will try to use Windows authentication to log in to the database, if you don't want it that way, you can modify
                    the conection strings present in two
                    <code>appsettings.json</code> files located in the following folders:      
                  </div>

              <li>[ApplicationName].Web</li>
              <li>Generator</li>
            </ul>
            <br>All other similar frameworks forces you to have your model in the same
            project that your website, with RAW Framework you can have a separated
            proyect with all your entities.
            <br>
            <br>Another thing that makes RAW framework different, is the it can generate
            code automatically for N:N and 1:N relationships without any problems and
            lets you define how those relationships occur in the database.&nbsp;

            <h3 draggable="true">Quick tutorial</h3>
            <p>Before you begin, be sure to have all the <a href="prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a> installed.
              <br>This is tutorial is based on the <a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/data/ef-mvc/intro.html" target="_blank">Contoso University tutorial</a> by Microsoft.
              <br>The database from the Contoso University tutorial from Microsoft is a little bit different to the one that we are going to use for this tutorial, the main difference is on some data types and that we use views to represent Students and Instructors instead of letting Entity Framework to automatically filter the data</p>
              <p>Our DB Schema is represented in the following image:</p>
            <img src="images/DBSchema.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <p style="" draggable="true">
                <br>Open a command prompt and navigate to a directory where your solution will be created, and run the following command:
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>rawc newApp</code>
                <br>
                <br>
                A name for your app will be asked, in this case we will use "ConUniv" as the name, remember that by default
                the scaffolding and the application is going to look for a database named as your solution's name on your local SQL Server Express instance, in this case is <code>ConUniv</code>, a folder with the same name as your application will
                be created and contains everything  you need to start building your application. Type <code>cd ConUniv</code> and open the <b>ConUniv.sln</b> file with 
                Visual Studio 2015 or open the folder <b>ConUniv.Web</b> with Visual Studio Code, this is the Solution structure that you will see:</p>
                <img src="images/demo1.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <br>
              <p>To start scaffolding we need to generate the models for the <b>tables</b> and <b>views</b> that we will be using, type the following commands to do it:</p>
              <ul class="list-group" style="">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[Course]</code></li>                
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[Instructor]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[Student]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[Department]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[CourseInstructor]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[Enrollment]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:model[OfficeAssignment]</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you want to generate models for the whole database(only tables, not views) type the following command:</p>
              <code>rawc new:full_db_models</code>
              <p>Sometimes it's easier to generate all the models and then remove it the ones that you don't need.</p>
              
              <p>If you navigate to your solution, you will notice that the models were added to the <b>[ApplicationName].DataLayer</b> project, under the <code>Models</code> folder.
              <br>
              Open one of the models, <code>Department.cs</code> for instance, and you will see that the model's properties have been decorated with some attributes,   
              </p>
              <img src="images/demo2.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <p><br>
                Those decorators are used <b>only</b> when the UI is generated, so if you want to change them, do it before you generate the UI.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will change a couple of them now, edit the <code>Instructor</code> and the <code>Student</code> files, we will replace the attributes added to the <code>Discrimitator</code> field, 
                we don't want the user to edit that field, so we replace them with the <code>Hidden</code> attribute, and the property in both classes should look like this:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="images/demo2.1.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <br> 
                For more information about all the available decorators go <a href="#modelsandviewmodels">here</a>.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                At this point we could generate with the framework the controllers, repositories, views and javascript files that we need to have CRUD functionality for each one of the models, for isntance, the following command will generate all the code for the Course model:                 
              </p>
              <code>rawc crudFor[Course]</code>
              <br>  
              <br>
              <p>
                Most of modern web applications use ajax to get and push data to the server but scaffolding solutions don't implement ajax calls, also many .Net code generators use helpers like HTML helpers or the new Tag helpers for the UI, Tag helpers was a 
                huge improvement over HTML helpers but still are not enough for a few reasons:
                <ul>
                  <li>The UI is technology dependant.</li>
                  <li>Harder interaction between designers and developers.</li>
                  <li>Page rendering is slower than pure html.</li>
                </ul>
                 The views generated by RAW framework are just html, so it's technology independant and facilitates team work between designers and developers, page rendering is faster and finally, the views(and everything) are generated based on templates that can be modified easily.
                 <br><br>
                 Another important thing about RAW framework is, that when developing real applications it's very rare that UI will use only one table, ViewModels are very popular developing Asp.Net MVC applications but frameworks in general or code generator don't support them, but RAW does, also calls to access data are async calls so your application will be using the server resources more efficiently.   
                <br>
                 For this tutorial we are going to use ViewModels and generate the CRUD for it, but first we will need to generate the repositories, type the following commands to do it:
                </p>
              <ul class="list-group" style="">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[Course]</code></li>                
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[Instructor]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[Student]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[Department]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[CourseInstructor]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[Enrollment]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[OfficeAssignment]</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>All the repositories were added to the <b>[ApplicationName].DataLayer</b> project, under the <code>Repositories</code> folder.
              <br>
              <p>
                The repositories help us to interact with the database, we create a repository for each table or view that we want  
                to interact with, repositories inherit from the <code>RepositoryBase</code> class and you can override any of it's methods if you need or you can modify the base class also.
              </p>

              <p>
                At this point we can create our ViewModel, for convention we strongly suggest that all the ViewModels must be located in the <b>[ApplicationName].BusinessLayer</b> project, under the <code>ViewModels</code> folder.
                <br>
                <br>
                Create these two ViewModels in the proper folder:
              </p>
              <img src="images/demo3.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <br>
              <img src="images/demo4.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                In the DepartmentViewModel we notice a few things:
                <ul>
                  <li>The class is decorated with the <code>NeedletailViewModel</code> attribute. If this attribute is missing, the RAW framework generator will not work.</li>
                  <li>The class inherits from the <code>ViewModelAutoLoadAndSaveAsync</code>. This is to let RAW load and save data automatically.</li>
                  <li>The Department property is decorated with the <code>Autocomplete</code> attribute. This attribute tells the generator how that field will be populated in the UI, in this case an autocomplete functionality is used to enter the data. </li>
                </ul>
                               
                <small>More about ViewModels <a href="#modelsandviewmodels">here</a>.</small>
                <br><br>
                We are ready to scaffold the ViewModels, type the following commands in the console:                
              </p>
              <ul class="list-group" style="">
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:crudFor[InstructorViewModel]</code></li>                
                <li class="list-group-item"><code>rawc new:repository[DepartmentViewModel]</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><small>*Since we already created the Instructor and Department repositories we get a confirmation prompt to overwrite existing files.</small></li>
              </ul>
              
              
              <p>
                Before run the app, we are going to make a couple of small adjustments on two methods inside the <code>InstructorController</code> class, this changes are only for a better UX.
                <br>
                 If you remeber, we used the Autocomplete attribute in the <code>DepartmentViewModel</code> class, this attribute allows the user to select a record from a list of records that match a search criteria, in this example, the InstructorID field is filled with a search by the  instructor's FirstName, we will make a small adjustment so the user can also search by the LastName, to do this we need to change the <code>GetTextForAutocomplete</code> and <code>Search</code> methods in the <code>InstructorController</code> class, the new version of the methods should look like this:
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <img src="images/demo5.png" class="img-responsive"/>
                <br>
                <br>            
              </p>
              <p>
                Run the app, on the home page you will see a couple of links to navigate to the Departments and Instructors generated functionality.
                   
              </p>
              <img src="images/demo6.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                Go to Department list and edit one of the existing records, you will see comething like this:   
              </p>
              <img src="images/demo7.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>
                Go to Instructor list and edit one of the existing records, you will see comething like this:

              <img src="images/demo8.png" class="img-responsive"/>
              

                <p contenteditable="true">
                  
                <p>With a few small changes in a couple  of minutes we can improve it like this:</p>
